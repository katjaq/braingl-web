		INTRODUCTION <br>
		<br>
		brainnetworks is a new open source web platform called brainGL to interactively publish functional and structural connectivity data directly in the web browser. The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.<br>

		Diffusion MRI: structural connectivity
		<br>
		<br>
		diffusion MRI tractography and selected the 9 major long-range fascicles (AF, SLF, IFOF, UNC, ILF, CG, CC, SCST and TR). 
		<br>
		<br>
		rs-fMRI: functional connectivity <br>
		For comparison of the functional bundles with the structural connectivity and the location of the fascicles surface connectivity maps and edge-bundled representations of thresholded functional connections between ROIs (Boettger et al. 2013). The connectivity data was exported to be visualized in the brainGL web application (http://conview.googlecode.com).
